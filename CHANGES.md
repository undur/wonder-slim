- **Unified the page cache: ERXAjaxSession's cache is now THE page cache, WO's private caches are never fed**
  One session-side `contextID -> live page instance` map now serves every restore — back button, component
  actions and ajax updates alike. `savePage` never calls super, so the storage routing decision (which cache
  does this page go in) is gone: an ajax update is just another alias for the same instance and can never
  evict the foreground page. Bounded by distinct page instances via WO's own knob, `WOPageCacheSize` /
  `WOApplication.pageCacheSize()` (note: that now counts retained live page trees, not backtrack steps —
  prefer small values). The repeated-request guard WO's cache used to provide moved with it: entries
  record request provenance and `ERXComponentRequestHandler` consults
  `ERXAjaxSession.contextIDForRepeatedRequest` instead of `_contextIDMatchingIDs` — gated on
  `isPageRefreshOnBacktrackEnabled()` exactly like stock WO (flag off = an identical re-submit
  re-executes the action, as always; flag on = the repeat re-renders the stored result, because that
  mode makes the browser re-issue requests during history navigation). The frames-era permanent page
  cache is obsolete and fails loudly: its machinery is deleted (`er.extensions.overridePrivateCache`
  and the storage itself, which had a leak in its dormant path) and `savePageInPermanentCache` now
  throws `UnsupportedOperationException` — instance-LRU eviction removed the context churn that
  permanent pages needed protection from, and silently downgrading a pinning request to LRU semantics
  would be a behavior change with no error. Also deleted the dead `original_context_id` header write.
  `er.extensions.maxPageReplacementCacheSize` is no longer used (startup WARN if set);
  per-store cache logging renamed to `er.extensions.appserver.ajax.ERXAjaxSession.logPageCache`.
  See `docs/UNIFIED_PAGE_CACHE.md`.

- **Added an updateContainerID binding to AjaxUpdateTrigger**

- **Moved response compression from dispatchRequest() to new class ERXResponseCompression**
  Makes the code easier on the eyes. Still considering full removal of response compression since that tends to be handled by the web server in most environments I know of. 
- **Moved ERXCompressionUtilities class into ERXResponseCompression and made it private.**
  Slim is not a generic compression framework, so it's reasonable that the only user of the code keeps it.
- **Renamed ERXHyperlink to ERXWOHyperlink**
  Naming conventions are good.
- **Renamed ERXSwitchComponent to ERXWOSwitchComponent**
  Naming conventions are good.
- **Removed ERXSession.javascriptEnabled**
  If you need this sort of functionality, do it yourself
- **Deleted ERXDirectAction.browser()**
  ERXRequest already holds a browser object and a direct action holds a request.

- **Deleted ERXGracefulShutdownHook**
  It's been disabled by default for a while. It used `sun.misc.Signal` and `Signalhandler` whose usage is not recommended. Use ERXShutdownHook instead.

- **Deleted `ERXApplication._startRequest()` and `ERXApplication._endRequest()`**

  If you need to do stuff before and after requests, override `dispatchRequest()`.

- **Moved the ERXExtensions.initApp(...) methods to new class ERXAppRunner**
  ERXExtensions should serve only as the ERExtensions framework's principal/initialization class

- **Removed threadInterrupt stuff from ERXRuntimeUtilities**
  Logic not actually used by any code inside the frameworks.

- **Deleted ERXArrayUtilities**

- **Deleted ERXActiveImage**
  Doesn't seem to serve any purpose

- **Deleted ERXWOPasswordField**
  The improvements offered by it are negligible in the age of ubiquitous https

- **Deleted userInfo() stuff from ERXResponse**
  It seems to have been there mostly to keep comptibility with older WO versions.

- **Removed pushContent(), popContent(), __setContent() etc. from ERXWOContext**
  Looks like the vestiges of a 13 year old experiment by mschrag.

## 2021-05-21

- **Deleted ERXDelayedRequestHandler**
  Cool idea, but reading the mailing list it seems to have it's problems. I'd prefer a mechanism that allows the programmer to consciously decide to use long responses when desired, not something that alters the global behaviour of the application.
- **Moved ERXBrowser and it's companions to a separate package; er.extensions.browser**
  The er.extensions.appserver package is pretty full as is
- **Deleted ERXTimestampUtilities**
  Modern java uses the classes from java.time.
- **Deleted ERXSelectorUtilities**
